# applytrack

Automated job application email tracker via IMAP with local LLM extraction and GDPR compliant Excel export.

---

## Project Goal
- Automated tracking of job application processes
- Retrieval of job application emails via IMAP
- Local LLM-based extraction of relevant information
- Structured consolidation of related applications for results
- Resolution of missing address data via defined fallbacks
  - Manual database
  - OpenRegister
  - Interactive completion
- GDPR-compliant, local processing
- Export of the following results into a predefined Excel template
  - Company names
  - Contact details
  - Contact persons
  - Job titles
  - Dates
  - Application status

---

## What issue does this fix?
- Avoidance of regex-based email parsing
- Job application emails are highly inconsistent in:
  - Structure
  - Language
  - Wording
- Regex-based solutions are therefore:
  - complex
  - error-prone
  - difficult to maintain
- Use of a local LLM for semantic extraction
- Advantages over regex:
  - more robust content extraction
  - fewer special cases
  - lower maintenance effort
